`train-habitat` is a Train plugin and is used as a Train Transport to connect to Habitat installations.

## To Install this as a User

`train-habitat` is included with InSpec 4.7.3 and later. There is no need to separately install this plugin.

## Using train-habitat from InSpec

As `train-habitat` takes potentially many options, it is simplest to list the options in your `~/.inspec/config.json` file, then used the named set of options with `-t`.

For example, if your config file contains:

```
{
  "file_version": "1.1",
  "credentials": {
    "habitat": {
      "dev-hab": {
        "api_url": "http://dev-hab.my-corp.io",
        "cli_ssh_host": "dev-hab.my-corp.io"
      },
      "prod-hab": {
        "api_url": "https://prod-hab.my-corp.io",
        "api_auth_token": "opensesame"
      },
    }
  }
}
```

Using this configuration, you could execute:

```
$ inspec exec some-profile -t habitat://dev-hab
# Or
$ inspec exec some-profile -t habitat://prod-hab
```

You may also pass `--config some-file.json` to use a config file at a different location.

See the next section for the full list of options you may use with a `habitat` credential set in your configuration.

## Using train-habitat from Ruby

The options that may be passed to `Train.create` are listed below.

### Dual-mode transport

Because Habitat exposes some facts by its HTTP Gateway API, and some facts by its CLI tool `hab`, this Train Transport has three modes of operation:

 * Using only the HTTP API (no ability to query packages, but rich ability to query rings)
 * Using only the `hab` CLI command (limitations TBD)
 * Using both (full capabilities)

When creating a `train-habitat` Connection, there are thus two sets of options, prefixed with `api_` and `cli_` respectively. You must provide at least one set.

### API-Mode options

API-mode options are used to connect to a Habitat Supervisor running with an exposed HTTP Gateway. They are prefixed with `api_`.

```ruby
Train.create(:habitat, api_url: 'http://my-hab.my-company.io:9631')
```

#### api_url

Required for API-mode use. This is an HTTP or HTTPS URL that identifies a Supervisor HTTP Gateway.  If the port is omitted from the URL, the API standard port of 9631 is assumed; to use port 80, specify it explicitly.

#### api_auth_token

The supervisor may be configured to require a [Bearer Token Authorization](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/using-habitat/#monitor-services-through-the-http-api), in which the client and the gateway use a pre-shared secret. Use this option to specify the secret.

### CLI Mode options

CLI options are more varied, and are entirely dependent on the underlying transport chosen to reach the CLI. For example, if there were a supported transport named 'radio' that took options 'channel' and 'band', specify them to train-habitat like this:

```ruby
Train.create(:habitat, {cli_radio_band: 'VHF', cli_radio_channel: 23})
```

`train-habitat` identifies the underlying "sub-transport" using the prefixes of the provided options. For example, if you pass an option named `cli_ssh_host`, `train-habitat` will recognize that you intend to use the SSH transport to connect to a location that has access to the `hab` CLI tool.

You may specify many options referring to the same sub-transport (such as credentials), but it is an error to specify more than one CLI sub-transport.

Currently supported CLI transports include:
 * SSH

Plans for future support include (in approximate order):
 * WinRM
 * Local
 * Docker

#### General Options

Any options not prefixed with `cli_` or `api_` are also passed to the CLI transport. This means you can use generic Train connection options such as the `sudo` and `shell` sets of options (see [train source code](https://github.com/inspec/train/blob/71679307903fc8853e09abd93f3901c83800e019/lib/train/extras/command_wrapper.rb#L31)), as well as `logger`.

#### SSH Options

`train-habitat` can accept any option that the Train SSH Transport accepts if the prefix `cli_ssh_` is added. This includes:

 * `cli_ssh_host` - String hostname or IP address
 * `cli_ssh_user` - String user to connect as
 * `cli_ssh_key_files` - Array of paths to private key files to use

Other options are available; see [train source code](https://github.com/inspec/train/blob/71679307903fc8853e09abd93f3901c83800e019/lib/train/transports/ssh.rb#L45) for details.
